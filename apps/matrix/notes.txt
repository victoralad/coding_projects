There are several other ways the matrix interface could have been done. Including:
    - overloading the operator << to allow the user enter a matrix similarly to how the 'Eigen' library does it.
    - having the user specify what type they want the matrix to be (i.e double, long, int, etc.)
    - have my program read in the matrix from a .txt file provided by the user.

I chose to overload the operator *, so as to allow my client to multiply as many
matrices as they wanted, without restricting them to a fixed number 
of matrices that can be multiplied at a time

I have tested my code with the examples in main.cpp
These examples include: 
    - multiplying multiple matrices in a single go
